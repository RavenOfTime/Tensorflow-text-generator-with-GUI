# Rnn Tensorflow Text Generator

Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for word-level language models in Python using TensorFlow.

Mostly reused code from https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow which was inspired from Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow 1.1.0rc0](http://www.tensorflow.org)
- PyQt5 
# Basic Usage
To train with default parameters on the tinyshakespeare corpus, run:
```bash
python train.py
```

To sample from a trained model
```bash
python 1.py
```

# Sample output

### Word-RNN
```
LEONTES:
Why, my Irish time?
And argue in the lord; the man mad, must be deserved a spirit as drown the warlike Pray him, how seven in.

KING would be made that, methoughts I may married a Lord dishonour
Than thou that be mine kites and sinew for his honour
In reason prettily the sudden night upon all shalt bid him thus again. times than one from mine unaccustom'd sir.

LARTIUS:
O,'tis aediles, fight!
Farewell, it himself have saw.

SLY:
Now gods have their VINCENTIO:
Whipt fearing but first I know you you, hinder truths.

ANGELO:
This are entitle up my dearest state but deliver'd.

DUKE look dissolved: seemeth brands
That He being and
full of toad, they knew me to joy.
